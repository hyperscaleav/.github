# Hyperscale AV

Enterprise-grade observability architecture for large-scale institutional AV environments.

Designed for governance. Built for scale. Operated in-house.

---

## Why

Large institutions operate AV across thousands of spaces and tens of thousands of devices.

They are expected to provide:

- Measurable performance
- Defensible reliability
- Governance alignment
- Risk visibility

Most AV environments were not engineered for structured observability at scale.

Telemetry is inconsistent. Health models are undefined. Monitoring is fragmented.

Observability must be designed — not improvised.

We build the architecture that makes it durable.

---

## The Architecture

Hyperscale AV operates across two primary surfaces:

### AV Observability Framework

A structured, tool-agnostic architecture for institutional observability.

It defines:

- Intent and outcome alignment
- Health modeling discipline
- Signal and data pipeline design
- Governance structure
- Phased activation

Platforms implement the framework. They do not define it.

---

### Omniglass

A self-hosted visibility plane implementing the AV Observability Framework.

- Zabbix-based
- Proxy-oriented
- Upgradeable
- Institution-owned
- Designed for large-scale environments

No SaaS lock-in. No per-device licensing.

---

## Education & Execution

The Framework is taught through Applied Monitoring.

It is implemented through the Observability Accelerator — a structured architecture-to-operation engagement for institutions operating at meaningful scale.

Architecture first. Execution second. Stewardship ongoing.

---

## Principles

We design for:

- **Manageability** — visibility and control at scale
- **Sovereignty** — extensible, explainable, institution-owned systems
- **Capability** — strengthening practitioner reasoning and discipline

Technology changes. Platforms change.  
Institutional responsibility does not.
